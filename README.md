# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI to provide actionable insights into employee data, helping HR managers and business leaders make data-driven decisions.
The dashboard focuses on:
     *Employee Strength & Performance – Understanding the total workforce and their average performance rating.
     *Employee Stability & Experience – Measuring job stability and workforce experience levels.
     *Promotion Expectations – Analyzing employees’ readiness for promotion.
     *Attrition Analysis – Monitoring employee attrition rate and identifying patterns.
     *Department, Gender, and Marital Status Distribution – Understanding workforce demographics.
     *Business Travel & Over-Time Analysis – Identifying workforce travel frequency and overtime contribution.
     *Job Role Distribution – Breaking down employee count by job roles.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
    -Power BI – For building interactive dashboard and data visualization.
    -Microsoft Excel – As the data source for employee records.
    -DAX – For calculated measures like attrition rate, employee performance score, and promotion expectation.

## 🔑 Key Insights
    -Employee Strength: 1470 employees in total.
    -Average Employee Performance: 3.15 out of 5.
    -Overall Attrition Rate: 16.12%, which is relatively high and needs HR intervention.
    -Department Distribution: Majority employees belong to Research & Development, followed by Sales.
    -Gender Ratio: Male 60%, Female 40%.
    -Business Travel: Most employees travel rarely (70%+), only a small portion travels frequently.
    -Overtime Work: 28% employees are working overtime – may contribute to attrition risk.

## 🧠 Learnings & Skills Demonstrated
    -Importing and cleaning data from Excel into Power BI.
    -Creating calculated columns and DAX measures (e.g., attrition rate).
    -Designing a professional and interactive dashboard using slicers and filters.
    -Using visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs for storytelling.
 
## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the Power BI file:
          *Install Power BI Desktop
